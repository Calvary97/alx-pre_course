This repository is my first Git trial and assignment, titled 0x01 Git. This is a demo of my practice using Git.
I have learned the fundamental concepts and Git commands. I have been practicing on the job, creating a repo, branching, committing changes, merging, pushing files, discussing with peers when I face challenges. I have developed an understanding of Git's ability to enable efficient and organized project management. 
There is more to learn. Yet practice makes perfect.
